    <h3>Professional Summary</h3>
    <div class="about_summary"><strong>From Factory Floors to Debugging Wars</strong></div>
    <p>
I’m a software engineer-in-training with a knack for turning breakdowns into breakthroughs. After leading in manufacturing, I brought that same servant-leader energy into tech—documenting every log, tracing every error, and finding the story inside the system. I thrive on step-by-step problem solving, but I’m not afraid to think outside the box (or rewire it if needed).
      Hi, I’m Darien Johnas — a software engineer student at Mid-State Tech.
      I’ve transitioned from a background in manufacturing leadership into tech
      because of medical challenges, and I’m passionate about bringing
      servant-leader energy into problem-solving, IT support, and coding
      projects.
